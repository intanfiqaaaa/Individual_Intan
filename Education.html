When I 7 years old, I enter primary school which is Sekolah Kebangsaan Penaga which is not far from my homme. 
At the time, I already know how to write and read. I started study a new subject In primary school and also have a examination to determine which high school can i apply.
In UPSR, I get flying colours and decide to apply for Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Sri Muda and at that school i take business and economy class and for SPM I get 5 A.
After SPM, I continue my study at UITM Merbok, Kedah and for now, I am the final year student in Diploma in Information Management.</p></span></p></font>
