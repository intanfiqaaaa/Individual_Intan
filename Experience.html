<p>After finishing high school, I worked in a Mat Kafe Ikan Bakar with my  friend as a waiter and cashier. i found out that they are looking for employees from facebook app. After that, I continued to apply for a job and go to the place for an interview.</p>
<p>My working hours are from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. I go to the restaurant using a motorcycle with a friend. I worked there for 4 months while waiting for the spm results to come out. </p>
<P>There was a day where the restaurant was so full with the customers and I couldnâ€™t take a break and need to work overtime, but I was happy because everything went smoothly even though it was a little busy.</p>
<p>At there I gained a lot of new experience and knowledge. I gained the skills to communicate with customers and be more punctual. Since working there, I have become a more trustworthy and responsible person.</p>
